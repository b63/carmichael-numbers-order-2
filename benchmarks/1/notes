In order for the maximum primes in the set P generated by  both Method_1 and Method_2
to be the same, the limit passed to Method_2 has be the square of the limit passed
to Method_1. This way both algorithms do the same amount of "work."

For Method_2, the limit puts a upper bound on the multiple of the divisors:
        (divisor of L') * k < limit
For Method_1, the limit puts a upper bound on the prime p that satisfies:
        (divisor of L') * k = p^2 - 1
