Elements of each set of size n: {2^55 * 1, , 2^55 * 2, ..., 2^55 * n}
Numbers are much larger, so mutliplication should take longer for larger subsets
The difference in times with and without caching gets larger:
    with smaller numbers, difference in time with size of set at 15 was ~1.7E7 ns
    with larger  numbers, difference grows to ~2.8E7 ns
